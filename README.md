# AutoPlay-Bot
"Do you ever find yourself watching offline shows and groaning every time you need to change episodes or hit pause? Same here! ðŸ™ˆ So, I created the Autoplay Bot with Hand Gesture Control to fix this life-altering 'problem.'

Now, with a simple wave of one finger (yes, just one), I can play or resume my episodes, and with five fingers, I can pause. No need to get up or fiddle with the keyboardâ€”my laziness is fully supported! ðŸ˜‚

Built with Python, ttkbootstrap, and the wizardry of OpenCV, this bot is proof that sometimes the best inventions come from doing the least. Check it outâ€”because who says lazy can't be innovative? ðŸ˜Ž"
